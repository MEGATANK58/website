# First Blog

Hey there everyone as you know that I've been building this website for quite a while now and I've always wanted to integrate blogs in my website and have finally been able to add them.

The blogs use a lot of code from the `/projects/:project` endpoint, such as *italic*, **bold** or ***both*** and of course code formatting:

```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```

I will be posting blogs every week *hopefully* but here is a [cool link]()
